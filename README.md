# genart

Creative coding experiments

## Python

The Python project can be setup with `poetry install`.
All experiments run from a single unified CLI:
Run `poetry run genart --help` to get a list of available commands and experiments.

## Rust

The Rust experiments are built on `nannou` and can simply be run with `cargo run`
in the experiment's directory.


## Experiments
